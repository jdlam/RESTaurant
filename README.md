# RESTaurant

What do I want this app to do?
Manage food through an admin page

### Approach

### User Stories
- User goes into general add page, and can add a table, add an order, and indicate which server is waiting them
- User goes into admin page, and can add, edit, delete menu items
- User goes to the main page and can easily read what tables, their server, and what they've ordered
- User can keep track of the bill of each table, and can print out a receipt
