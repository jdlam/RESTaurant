# RESTaurant

Servers can add tables and add orders
Admins can manage servers and menu items
Chefs can alert servers that their food is ready



### Approach

### User Stories
- User goes into general add page, and can add a table, add an order, and indicate which server is waiting them
- User goes into admin page, and can add, edit, delete menu items
- User goes to the main page and can easily read what tables, their server, and what they've ordered
- User can keep track of the bill of each table, and can print out a receipt

### How It Works

### Goals
- Make All Pages Responsive
  - ~~Admin~~
  - ~~Servers~~
  - ~~Foods~~
  - Parties
  - Orders
  - Chef
- Finish Orders
- Chef's page
- When the table leaves, the party disappears, but is still in database
  - Make a new table full of paid Orders
- When chef gets orders, the order is in a single list
- Changes colors when time passes a certain limit
- Chef can press the button when the order is complete
- Waiter's party color changes when food is ready
- Receipt Printout with 15%, 20%, and 25% tip suggestion
